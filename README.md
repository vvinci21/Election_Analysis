Deliverable 3: Written Analysis of the Election Audit (20 points)
Deliverable 3 Instructions
Use your repository README to write your analysis of Deliverables 1 and 2. The analysis should contain the following:

##Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.

###Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

* How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
* Which county had the largest number of votes?
* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
* Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
* Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be usedâ€”with some modificationsâ€”for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

## Deliverable 3: Analysis of the Election Audit
### 1) Overview of Election Audit:
> Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis:

A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following task to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

* Calculate the total number of votes cast.
* Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
* Calculatae the total number of votes each candidate received.
* Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
* Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

After giving you an overview of the election audit tasks, we wants to go over the steps required in detail. Showing you a technique commonly used by programmers to write steps of their code, which is called `pseudocode`. Pseudocode will make the audit easier to present to nontechnical colleagues and stakeholders.

In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run:

* Total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* Total number of votes each candidate received
* Percentage of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote
